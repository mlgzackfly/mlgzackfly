About Me
---
Hi, my name is Marco  
I am currently studying Business Administration in Bussiness Computing at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology. Although I don't have any internship experience, I have been actively involved in various information communities and have gained valuable skills and knowledge through these experiences. I am a proactive team player and have excellent communication skills. I am excited about the opportunity to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I believe I would be a valuable asset to any team.
