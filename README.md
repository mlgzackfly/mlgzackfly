# Marco – Security Engineer · Founder of Fenryx

## Executive Profile

I am a **Security Engineer** specializing in **offensive security research, threat intelligence, and security tooling development**. As the founder of **Fenryx**, I architect resilient systems by integrating adversarial perspectives into engineering workflows.

My work spans **security automation**, **penetration testing**, and **adversarial experimentation against Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**, delivering measurable risk reduction and engineering-enabling insights.
Fenryx operates under a principle: *resilience emerges from understanding how systems fail before designing how they endure*.
